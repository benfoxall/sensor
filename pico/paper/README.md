# Microcontroller source

## I'm not familiar with C development, I'd love any feedback about how to improve this code / structure

The hardware I've got:

- [Pi Pico w][picow]
- [Waveshare ePaper 2.13][epaper]

Approach:

1. Followed [the docs][cpp] for setting up a new project via VSCode
2. Copied in examples from [waveshare]
3. Copied in [QRCode][qrcode] source
4. Hacked things together until stuff worked
